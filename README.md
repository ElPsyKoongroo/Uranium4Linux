<h1>What is Uranium4Linux ?</h1>
<p>
Uranium4Linux is a blazingly fast minecraft modpack manager capable of making, downloading and updating modpacks.


<br><br>

<h2>Utilities</h2>

- [x] Make modpacks from minecraft dir 
- [x] Download modpacks 
- [ ] Updating modpacks

<br><br>

<h2> TODOS! </h2>

- [ ] Because i recently changed they way Uranium4Linux makes modpacks i also need to update the way how it update them.

Avalible repositories: <br>
- RINTH
- CURSE*

*As a personal desicion im thinking about removing support for Curse repository. Curse is a privative platform with some shitty policies about the management of their content. Also I really appreciate what ModRinth is doing
with the minecraft mod community so I think the best way to support this project is to fully focus on their
modpack format !
